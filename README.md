# Breakout_cpp

## Intorduction:
Welcome to my version of the classic arcade game **Breakout**, which I developed using **C++** and **SDL**. As an aspiring game developer, I wanted to build on the skills I learned while creating my first game, Pong. This project gave me the opportunity to further hone my C++ programming skills and learn more about game development. I hope you enjoy playing my version of Breakout as much as I enjoyed building it.

## Features:
In my version of Breakout, players must knock down eight rows of bricks using the walls and a paddle to hit a ball and destroy the bricks. The game features two rows of bricks in each of four different colors. The player earns points for each brick they destroy: yellow bricks earn one point, green bricks earn three points, orange bricks earn five points, and red bricks earn seven points. If the player misses the ball and it goes out of bounds, they lose a turn. Players have a total of three turns to clear all the bricks on the screen. However, if the player hits a red brick, the paddle shrinks to half its size and the ball moves faster, making the game more challenging.

## Usage:
### How to run the game:
1. Download the game files from the repository.
2. Extract the files to a convinient location on your computer. **you must have a windows machine**
3. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (such as SDL and any relevant C++ libraries.
4. Make sure you have mingw installed cause you're gonna need mingw32-make to make the executable.
5. Run the executable and play the game.
**I'm working on fixing the installer for the game so you don't have to do all these steps**
### How to play the game:
The game features four different maps of bricks to provide players with unique challenges: standard, pyramid, 1337 (a tribute to my school), and crazy. Players can move the paddle using the left and right arrow keys and pause the game using the ESC key. If you want to exit the game and return to the main menu, press the ESC key again. Additionally, players can mute the sound in the settings menu.
